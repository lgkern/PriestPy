There are many other circumstances where using it early would be better anyway, so you won't lose VoiT casts. \n\tNever under any circumstance intentionally hold VoiT until after mindbender has finished, nor attempt to use two VoiTs in the same Voidform without S2M.

This is magnified by the increased gain of intellect per ilvl compared to secondaries. The outcome of this is that in the majority of situations where two pieces of gear are weighted against one another the one with the higher ilvl usually wins out! So, as with previous iterations of the spec - ilvl is usually king! Common exceptions to this could be Azerite armor with uniquely strong traits or certain trinkets with strong/over budgeted effects.
