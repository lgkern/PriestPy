This is normal, totally expected, happens every single tier, and is nothing new.\n\n- Many guilds go into Heroic Raid with their full roster which is often >20 members. Discipline cooldowns don't scale well past 20 people compared to other healers due to the nature of how ramping/atonement works.\n- Disc is very reliant on knowledge of the bosses and damage patterns in order to perform. Many bosses either don't get tested properly or receive significant changes from its PTR version.\n- Boss timers like BigWigs or DBM aren't always accurate during the first few days of the raid release, sometimes longer.\n\nWe will be fine once we move into Mythic, have more knowledge of the encounters, and the amazing developers of the boss timer addons get a chance to update their stuff.",

The outcome of this is that in the majority of situations where two pieces of gear are weighted against one another the one with the higher ilvl usually wins out! So, as with previous iterations of the spec - ilvl is usually king! Common exceptions to this could be tier sets or certain trinkets with strong/over budgeted effects.
