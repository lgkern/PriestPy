	"mindbender": "In order to apply Glyphs to Mindbender you need to first un-talent it, then apply the glyph, and then talent back into Mindbender. <https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1067>",
	"mfi": "You should aim to almost always full channel Mind Flay: Insanity. The duration is quite short and typically cancelling it would not realistically get you to cast the spell you would cancel for that much faster. If you find yourself in a situation where you are capped on Insanity mid-channel you should cancel but realistically if you got into this situation you probably should not have pressed it to begin with. Overwriting the buff is perfectly fine.\n For more info check: <https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-rotation-cooldowns-abilities>",
	"publik": "Every day I wake up, then I start to find bugs, lonely is a Priest without bugs.\nEvery day I start out, then I cry my heart out, lonely is a Priest without bugs.\nCurrent Bug list: <https://bit.ly/3N6p5X4>",
	"mindcontrol": "Generally speaking there are not very many mobs that are worth going out of your way to Mind Control. For most keys its quite situational but can help if you want to make a pack slightly easier. Other than that there are no big examples that make things significantly easier for your group.\n\nSome examples:\n- Spiteful Shades\n- Controlling Bolstering (low health mob before it gets a stack)\n- Temple Adept (VP)",
	"dungeonsims": "If you are looking to sim your Shadow Priest in a Mythic+ environment check out this post detailing various methods: <https://warcraftpriests.com/shadow-priest-dungeon-sims/>",
	"psychiclink": "Psychic Link works with every single target spell in our kit, including Devouring Plague initial hit and ticks. It does not work with Shadowy Apparitions, Vampiric Touch, or Shadow Word: Pain. Note that the damage from Psychic Link does not count towards Vampiric Embrace as of 10.1.\n\nIt requires you to be in line of sight and in range of any targets you want to hit.",
	"lariat": "Starting with Patch 10.1 Elemental Lariat has been nerfed. You now need 7 sockets of the same gem element for the value to equal the 10.0 version. This change makes it much less desireable while gearing up, and even with full BiS is not desireable for Shadow Priests.",
	"larry": "lariat",
	"spore": "Undulating Sporecloak is a new defensive embellishment in 10.1. The defensive value makes it quite powerful and in the grand scheme the 1% damage you get from an embellishment effect is worth giving up to use this cloak. <https://www.wowhead.com/item=205025/undulating-sporecloak>",
	"distortedreality": "**Why is Distorted Reality not always better than Minds Eye?**\n\nThe simple answer is that on single target scenarios casting less Devouring Plagues is not worth the minimal gain in Devouring Plague duration. Getting more Surge of Insanity procs, Shadowy Apparitions, and Screams of the Void uptime hurts Distorted Reality in single target. Outside of that in any sustained multi-target you will see good results from Distorted Reality. In Mythic+ things get tricky, you will run into more cases where it will expire early from mobs dying, which hurts the overall value of the talent in that case. That being said it can be great for people that are new to the spec without realistically losing too much damage.",
	"cthun": "Idol of C'Thun procs Void Lasher that casts Mind Sear when facing 3 or more targets. Otherwise it will spawn a Void Tendril that casts Mind Flay. This goes off of how many targets are near your main target when you get a spawn, not how many mobs you are in combat with.",
	"feedback": "We strongly encourage posting feedback directly to the forums. The developers do not read discord so if you want the best shot at them making changes you need to voice your feedback in a constructive and respectful way on the forums: <https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/classes/priest/182>",
	"spoils": "The best way to use Spoils of Neltharus is just sync it with Power Infusion using whatever buff is currently active. We have not found it is worth to delay cooldowns to get a Haste or Mastery buff. While you can use instant casts like Fade or other things to game the buff right before you press it make sure you are not sacrificing your defensive value. The differences in the buffs are not significant for Shadow Priests. SimC just uses this with Power Infusion as well.",
	"bsl": "Blue Silken Lining embellishment DOES stack although it can be buggy. If you are not seeing the tooltip of the Mastery get doubled you need to unequip those gear pieces and put them on at the same time (potentially a few times) to get the correct stats from both.",
	"mindspike": "Mind Spike and Mind Melt are suggested over Mind Flay in almost every scenario. Mind Spike is a shorter cast and is easier to fit into windows where the rotation is busy and less punishing if you have to cancel a Surge of Insanity proc mid-way through. Cancelling Mind Flay: Insanity means the proc is wasted, but Mind Spike: Insanity is not consumed until the cast is finished. For this reason it is suggested you take Mind Spike if you are looking for overall damage. If you really hate spike that much you can drop these two points for Voidtouched + another flex point, all sims and data shows this is worse but not by a crazy amount (usually 1-4% range).\n\nYou might see folks that push keys run Mind Flay builds, but there is no evidence that points towards dropping Mind Spike ever making sense for overall damage. Anyone that claims that its better has not provided evidence as to why it is, and all of our testing points against Mind Flay in every scenario. At the end of the day you can time 25+ keys with almost any build as Shadow, anyone that chooses Mind Flay is just taking a 1-4% DPS loss. This video goes over some of these points in depth: <https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1832599457>\n\nFor more info on Mythic+ builds and options with talents check out the guide: <https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-mythic-plus-tips>",
	"incorporeal": "The best way to deal with Incorporeal is with Shackle Undead or Dominate Mind. Dominate Mind will cause the target to cast on enemies instead (5% per cast), but this can pull things you do not intend so use it carefully. Psychic Horror does also work but it is not very effective. Psychic Scream and Void Tendrils do not work.",
	"ominous": "By default Raidbots uses whatever you have set in the custom option settings when simming it. It does not take into account your current flight in-game. As a Shadow Priest you can use Azure (Mastery), Bronze (Haste), Emerald (Critical Strike), or Obsidian and still get good results to fill out the flights for your group. Can always sim it to know for sure.",
	"oce": "ominous",
	"entangling": "The best way to deal with Entangling is by taking Phantasm and using Fade to clear the debuff. You can take Improved Fade to easily fit this in for every set.",
	"afflicted": "The best way to deal with Afflicted as a Priest is by using _Improved Purify_ (Holy/Disc) or _Purify Disease_ (Shadow). _Dispel Magic_ (Shadow) or _Mass Dispel_ do **NOT** work.",

This is normal, totally expected, happens every single tier, and is nothing new.\n\n- Many guilds go into Heroic Raid with their full roster which is often >20 members. Discipline cooldowns don't scale well past 20 people compared to other healers due to the nature of how ramping/atonement works.\n- Disc is very reliant on knowledge of the bosses and damage patterns in order to perform. Many bosses either don't get tested properly or receive significant changes from its PTR version.\n- Boss timers like BigWigs or DBM aren't always accurate during the first few days of the raid release, sometimes longer.\n\nWe will be fine once we move into Mythic, have more knowledge of the encounters, and the amazing developers of the boss timer addons get a chance to update their stuff.",

	"shadow.crafted": "**Shadow Priest Crafting Suggestions**\nWhen crafting items you want to prioritize getting embellished gear pieces. After that you can focus on crafting pieces with the biggest ilevel increase. As a Shadow Priest you should use some combination of **Blue-Silken Lining (BSL)** and **Shadowflame-Tempered Armor Patch (STAP)**. You can stack these. BSL has the highest damage ceiling and scales well as you add targets, but can be less valuable when you are taking damage. STAP is more consistent but does not scale as well in multi-target. You can also run **Undulating Sporecloak**, which is a great defensive option. Here is your rough priority:\n\n1. and 2. BSL, STAP, or Undulating Sporecloak\n BSL can be placed on any armor or weapon piece and STAP on non-JC armor pieces, would suggest putting it on the biggest upgrade item for your current gear in a non-tier slot. Raidbots sims default BSL to 70% uptime to be more accurate.\n3. Craft another piece of gear for any armor slot that is the biggest upgrade with the **Alchemical Flavor Pocket**. This is an extra effect but does not count as one of your two embellished items.\n4. Continue to craft items that give your character the biggest upgrade prioritizing non tier slots. Consider crafting the **Engineering Wrists** to get a battle-rez option for keys, even if you are not an engineer.\n\nGuide: <https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-gear-best-in-slot>",

This is magnified by the increased gain of intellect per ilvl compared to secondaries. The outcome of this is that in the majority of situations where two pieces of gear are weighted against one another the one with the higher ilvl usually wins out! So, as with previous iterations of the spec - ilvl is usually king! Common exceptions to this could be tier sets or certain trinkets with strong/over budgeted effects. For more help/resourses on this matter and more check out #disc-faq!",
