This is magnified by the increased gain of intellect per ilvl compared to secondaries. The outcome of this is that in the majority of situations where two pieces of gear are weighted against one another the one with the higher ilvl usually wins out! So, as with previous iterations of the spec - ilvl is usually king! Common exceptions to this could be tier sets or certain trinkets with strong/over budgeted effects.
