	"mindbender": "In order to apply Glyphs to Mindbender you need to first un-talent it, then apply the glyph, and then talent back into Mindbender. <https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1067>",
	"mfi": "You should aim to almost always full channel Mind Flay: Insanity, especially on single target. The duration is quite short and typically cancelling it would not realistically get you to cast the spell you would cancel for that much faster. If you find yourself in a situation where you are capped on Insanity mid-channel you should cancel but realistically if you got into this situation you probably should not have pressed it to begin with. Overwriting the buff is perfectly fine.\n For more info check: <https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-rotation-cooldowns-abilities>",
	"publik": "Every day I wake up, then I start to find bugs, lonely is a Priest without bugs.\nEvery day I start out, then I cry my heart out, lonely is a Priest without bugs.\nCurrent Bug list: <https://bit.ly/3N6p5X4>",
	"mindcontrol": "Generally speaking there are not very many mobs that are worth going out of your way to Mind Control. For most keys its quite situational but can help if you want to make a pack slightly easier. Other than that there are no big examples that make things significantly easier for your group.\n\nSome examples:\n- Spiteful Shades\n- Controlling Bolstering (low health mob before it gets a stack)\n\n For other examples check out the guide here: <https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-mythic-plus-tips>",
	"dungeonsims": "If you are looking to sim your Shadow Priest in a Mythic+ environment check out this post detailing various methods: <https://warcraftpriests.github.io/bookofshadows/guides/dungeonsims>",
	"psychiclink": "Psychic Link works with every single target spell in our kit, including Devouring Plague initial hit and ticks. It does not work with Shadowy Apparitions, Vampiric Touch, or Shadow Word: Pain. Note that the damage from Psychic Link does not count towards Vampiric Embrace as of 10.1.\n\nIt requires you to be in line of sight and in range of any targets you want to hit.",
	"lariat": "Elemental Lariat requires 8 sockets to get the full value out of it (1 epic gem + 7 rare gems). If you are lacking sockets it is likely not worth using over other embellished items as a Shadow Priest.",
	"larry": "lariat",
	"spore": "Undulating Sporecloak is a relatively weak embellished item that has small damage and defensive value. In 10.2 they reduced the amount it shields but added Versatility while above 70% health. It is roughly `0.5%` DPS upgrade on single target and generally not worth using over other throughput embellishments as a Shadow Priest. You can opt to use it for the small defensive benefit if you want that.",
	"distortedreality": "**When should you use Distorted Reality (DR) instead of Minds Eye (ME)?**\n\nGenerally speaking DR is going to give you slightly more overall damage and makes it easier to maintain Devouring Plague in single target. Mind's Eye is preferred inside of Mythic+ if you are specifically looking for single-target priority while AoE'ing. When using DR you should aim to spread it every time you get enough Insanity to do so, should happen naturally on 2-3 targets in a pack. More info: <https://youtu.be/RKW0BIUgT_k>",
	"cthun": "Idol of C'Thun procs Void Lasher that casts Mind Sear when facing 3 or more targets. Otherwise it will spawn a Void Tendril that casts Mind Flay. This goes off of how many targets are near your main target when you get a spawn, not how many mobs you are in combat with.",
	"feedback": "We strongly encourage posting feedback directly to the forums. The developers do not read discord so if you want the best shot at them making changes you need to voice your feedback in a constructive and respectful way on the forums: <https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/classes/priest/182>",
	"spoils": "The best way to use Spoils of Neltharus is just sync it with Power Infusion using whatever buff is currently active. We have not found it is worth to delay cooldowns to get a Haste or Mastery buff. While you can use instant casts like Fade or other things to game the buff right before you press it make sure you are not sacrificing your defensive value. The differences in the buffs are not significant for Shadow Priests. SimC just uses this with Power Infusion as well.",
	"bsl": "Blue Silken Lining embellishment DOES stack although it can be buggy. If you are not seeing the tooltip of the Mastery get doubled you need to un-equip those gear pieces and put them on at the same time (potentially a few times) to get the correct stats from both. You can also drop below 90% and go back above to fix this. Once its fixed you should be good to go unless you are constantly swapping between 1 and 2 equipped.",
	"mindspike": "Mind Spike and Mind Flay are very close together in terms of DPS value. Typically as you add targets you will see the value of Mind Flay builds increase, specifically because the other talents we take instead of Mind Spike scale a bit better. Mind Flay is generally preferred with Void Eruption and Mind Spike with Dark Ascension.",
	"incorporeal": "The best way to deal with Incorporeal is with Shackle Undead or Dominate Mind. Dominate Mind will cause the target to cast on enemies instead (5% per cast), but this can pull things you do not intend so use it carefully. Psychic Horror does also work but it is not very effective. Psychic Scream and Void Tendrils do not work.",
	"ominous": "By default Raidbots uses whatever you have set in the custom option settings when simming it. It does not take into account your current flight in-game. As a Shadow Priest you can use Azure (Mastery), Bronze (Haste), Emerald (Critical Strike), or Obsidian and still get good results to fill out the flights for your group. Can always sim it to know for sure. Check out the pin in #shadow-questions to make simming this easier.",
	"oce": "ominous",
	"entangling": "The best way to deal with Entangling is by taking Phantasm and using Fade to clear the debuff. You can take Improved Fade to easily fit this in for every set.",
	"afflicted": "The best way to deal with Afflicted as a Priest is by using _Improved Purify_ (Holy/Disc) or _Purify Disease_ (Shadow). _Dispel Magic_ (Shadow) or _Mass Dispel_ do **NOT** work.",
	"mass": "Mass Dispel has many uses in Season 4 Mythic+ dungeons. Almost every dungeon has something where this can help with, check out the guide for the **full list** of things that can be dispelled: <https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-mythic-plus-tips#mass>.",
	"logreview": "Check out the [log review](<https://gist.github.com/seanpeters86/0079136f148c49aae7bcb807c72ccb9d>) guide for Shadow Priests. Learning how to analyze your own logs is crucial to improving as a player.",
	"umbrel": "By default Umbrelskul's Fractured Heart execute component will not show on details or Warcraftlogs. You can use [this WeakAura](<https://wago.io/lXT9wfXYl>) to show this in details though.",
	"rings": "For Shadow Priests we suggest purchasing the two fire-dmg rings with bullions early on. This is because gear sets at BiS level will want to integrate these rings in ideal cases and they will beat out other choices, even if the damage throughput itself seems minor. This might be a small gain to start with until you can build your stats around them to take advantage of this 'free' proc that doesn't reduce overall secondary stats. You can expect somewhere in the range of 0.5% damage from the proc with just Helm Enchant + Vakash. If you add in Vessel this can be upwards of 2-3%. More info on the [gear guide](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-gear-best-in-slot>).\n\nYou might see that certain trinkets would be a better short-term DPS gain, but there are so many strong farmable trinkets out there this is typically not a long term choice, but might be more of what you are looking for. At the end of the day this is just guidance, feel free to make the decision that works best for your character.",
	"call": "Neltharion's Call to Suffering can be a strong competitive trinket choice as a Shadow Priest. On average sims will get about 20% uptime of the trinket, making it good especially at the increased item level of 535 when fully upgraded. The downside however is that the low proc rate and uptime makes it extremely inconsistent, and you can easily get pulls where it will never proc during cooldowns, making it worse than the average it will sim for. At the same time if you proc it during cooldowns you can do Old God levels of damage. If this RNG playstyle sounds fun to you this can be an S-tier trinket, but for most people we suggest [exploring other options](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-gear-best-in-slot>) to have more consistent DPS, especially early on. The proc visual is BiS though so there is that!",

Prayer of Mending paths towards Spell Warding, and generally out competes its competitor(Holy Nova). It alone is not a high value/priority point, however it is the best path towards the left side of the tree.",

Take any PI spreadsheets you see with a grain of salt. The best PI target is usually the best DPS in your group, or whoever your Raid Leader tells you to use it on.\n\nGeneral Top Specs to give PI to: Beast Mastery Hunter, Marksmanship Hunter, Assassination Rogue, Devastation Evoker, and Unholy DK (3 minute timer).\n\nIf you are looking for Power Infusion macros check out the guide here: <https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-macros-addons>",
  	"heroicweek":"```md\n# Discipline Priest During Heroic Release Week\n```\n:octagonal_sign: No, the sky isn't falling.\n:octagonal_sign: No, Discipline isn't dead.\n:octagonal_sign: No, we don't need massive buffs.\n\nDiscipline Priest, for a variety of reasons, always underperforms during the first week of the tier by a significant margin. This is normal, totally expected, happens every single tier, and is nothing new.\n\n- Many guilds go into Heroic Raid with their full roster which is often >20 members. Discipline cooldowns don't scale well past 20 people compared to other healers due to the nature of how ramping/atonement works.\n- Disc is very reliant on knowledge of the bosses and damage patterns in order to perform. Many bosses either don't get tested properly or receive significant changes from its PTR version.\n- Boss timers like BigWigs or DBM aren't always accurate during the first few days of the raid release, sometimes longer.\n\nWe will be fine once we move into Mythic, have more knowledge of the encounters, and the amazing developers of the boss timer addons get a chance to update their stuff.",

After that you can focus on crafting pieces with the biggest ilevel increase. As a Shadow Priest you should use **Allied Wristguards of Time Dilation** and one of **Hood of Surging Time** (Mythic+ only) **Blue-Silken Lining**, **Elemental Lariat**, or **Shadowflame-Tempered Armor Patch (STAP)**.\n\nWhen deciding where to use your Sparks first I would suggest simming these choices. Upgrading will depend heavily on your current gear options. Keep in mind with 10.2 we have many cantrip weapons from Raid and Mythic+ so crafting a main-hand weapon is not quite as valuable.\n\nFor more information check out https://discord.com/channels/118456785047781384/1170438451276030003/1170498399901077594",

This is magnified by the increased gain of intellect per ilvl compared to secondaries. The outcome of this is that in the majority of situations where two pieces of gear are weighted against one another the one with the higher ilvl usually wins out! So, as with previous iterations of the spec - ilvl is usually king! Common exceptions to this could be tier sets or certain trinkets with strong/over budgeted effects.
